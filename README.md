HOW-TO

This is a maven project.
To build the project , run 'mvn clean install'. (this command also runs the tests).

To run the application you have to launch the jar (using the following command) which will take as input a file mowers.csv located in the same path.
java -jar mowers-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar

To try different combinations, just change the contents of the default file 'mowers.csv'.
