HOW-TO
This is a maven project.
To build the project , run 'mvn clean install'. (this command also runs the tests).

The FilePortController class runs the application from the main method, which takes a file in the defined path and processes it to generate the output file with the required result, in a file called 'mowersOutput.csv';

To try different combinations, just change the contents of the default file 'mowers.csv'.
